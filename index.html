    <h2 id="dragonborn_history">The History of the Dragonborn</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3 id="merethic_era"> Merethic Era </h3>
    <p>Miraak, who lived during the Dragon War of the Merethic Era, became known as the First Dragonborn. The three tongues, Hakon One-Eye, Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, and Felldir the Old, who led the charge against Alduin had asked Miraak for his aid, though Miraak denied, having other plans. Miraak would eventually be defeated in combat by Vahlok the Jailor, though saved by Hermaeus Mora.</p>

    <h3 id="first_era">First Era</h3>
    <p>During the First Era, the Nedic slave rebellion in Cyrodiil against the Ayleids would take place, being led by Slave Queen Alessia. Alessia, being a Dragonborn, was gifted the Amulet of Kings by Akatosh, which would be used to light the Dragonfires and keep the armies of Oblivion at bay. Alessia's line would continue with more Dragonborn Emperors and Empresses, until their deaths.</p>

    <p>In 1E 2703, the Akaviri attempted an invasion of Tamriel, which would eventually be foiled by the efforts of Reman Cyrodiil. The exact nature of the defeat of the Akaviri is unknown, though it is known that they were not seeking for combat with Reman, but were instead searching for him, as he was Dragonborn. Under Reman Cyrodiil, the Dragon blood officially became part of becoming a legitimate Emperor, as he included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, and the lighting of the Dragonfires, in the rites of becoming an Emperor. His dynasty would continue until the death of Juilek Cyrodiil during the Four Score War.</p>

    <h3 id="second_era"> Second Era</h3>
    <p>As of 2E 579, it had been years since the last Dragonborn Emperor had ruled. Following his successful rebellion against the Longhouse Emperors, Varen Aquilarios aimed to legitimize his rule through lighting the Dragonfires. Varen was not a Dragonborn, and was convinced by Mannimarco to participate in a ritual, which would end up being a trick. Instead of becoming a Dragonborn, Varen and his companions were forced to the ground, while Mannimarco corrupted the power of the Amulet of Kings to trigger the Soulburst, and eventually Planemeld, until it was stopped by the Vestige.</p>

    <p>After Kaalgrontiid and his kin were freed from the Halls of Colossus, one such dragon named Sahrotnax was captured by the Hollowfang Clan of vampires with the assistance of the rouge Dragonguard Grundwulf, who then proceeded to drink his blood believing it would make him Dragonborn and with that power unite the fractured Empire once more. Though the ritual granted him extraordinary abilities, he was slain shortly afterward.</p>

    <p>Years later, in 2E 828, another Dragonborn would be placed on the world. This Dragonborn being Tiber Septim. Tiber Septim would learn the Thu'um from Wulfharth, and meet the Greybeards shortly after, who told him he was destined to unite Tamriel. During his campaigns in Cyrodiil, he would find the Amulet of Kings during the Battle of Sancre Tor against the Nord-Breton Alliance. After having become Emperor, Tiber Septim declared the start of the Third Era.</p>
