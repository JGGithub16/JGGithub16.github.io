    <h2 id="dragonborn_history">The History of the Dragonborn</h2>
    <hr/>
    <div class="body_text">
    <h3 id="merethic_era"> Merethic Era </h3>
    <p>Miraak, who lived during the Dragon War of the Merethic Era, became known as the First Dragonborn. The three tongues, Hakon One-Eye, Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, and Felldir the Old, who led the charge against Alduin had asked Miraak for his aid, though Miraak denied, having other plans. Miraak would eventually be defeated in combat by Vahlok the Jailor, though saved by Hermaeus Mora.</p>

    <h3 id="first_era">First Era</h3>
    <p>During the First Era, the Nedic slave rebellion in Cyrodiil against the Ayleids would take place, being led by Slave Queen Alessia. Alessia, being a Dragonborn, was gifted the Amulet of Kings by Akatosh, which would be used to light the Dragonfires and keep the armies of Oblivion at bay. Alessia's line would continue with more Dragonborn Emperors and Empresses, until their deaths.</p>

    <p>In 1E 2703, the Akaviri attempted an invasion of Tamriel, which would eventually be foiled by the efforts of Reman Cyrodiil. The exact nature of the defeat of the Akaviri is unknown, though it is known that they were not seeking for combat with Reman, but were instead searching for him, as he was Dragonborn. Under Reman Cyrodiil, the Dragon blood officially became part of becoming a legitimate Emperor, as he included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, and the lighting of the Dragonfires, in the rites of becoming an Emperor. His dynasty would continue until the death of Juilek Cyrodiil during the Four Score War.</p>

    <h3 id="second_era"> Second Era</h3>
    <p>As of 2E 579, it had been years since the last Dragonborn Emperor had ruled. Following his successful rebellion against the Longhouse Emperors, Varen Aquilarios aimed to legitimize his rule through lighting the Dragonfires. Varen was not a Dragonborn, and was convinced by Mannimarco to participate in a ritual, which would end up being a trick. Instead of becoming a Dragonborn, Varen and his companions were forced to the ground, while Mannimarco corrupted the power of the Amulet of Kings to trigger the Soulburst, and eventually Planemeld, until it was stopped by the Vestige.</p>

    <p>After Kaalgrontiid and his kin were freed from the Halls of Colossus, one such dragon named Sahrotnax was captured by the Hollowfang Clan of vampires with the assistance of the rouge Dragonguard Grundwulf, who then proceeded to drink his blood believing it would make him Dragonborn and with that power unite the fractured Empire once more. Though the ritual granted him extraordinary abilities, he was slain shortly afterward.</p>

    <p>Years later, in 2E 828, another Dragonborn would be placed on the world. This Dragonborn being Tiber Septim. Tiber Septim would learn the Thu'um from Wulfharth, and meet the Greybeards shortly after, who told him he was destined to unite Tamriel. During his campaigns in Cyrodiil, he would find the Amulet of Kings during the Battle of Sancre Tor against the Nord-Breton Alliance. After having become Emperor, Tiber Septim declared the start of the Third Era.</p>

    <h3 id="third_era"> Third Era</h3>
    <p>Tiber Septim's dynasty of Dragonborn Emperors would continue to rule the Third Empire until the Oblivion Crisis. Under the reign of Emperor Uriel Septim VII, the Mythic Dawn attempted to slay the Dragonborn Emperors and thus provide Mehrunes Dagon with the means to cross over into Tamriel. Uriel Septim and his three sons were assassinated, with only his bastard son, Martin Septim having survived. The leader of the Mythic Dawn cult, Mankar Camoran, was likewise a Dragonborn, able to speak fire[28] and wear the Amulet of Kings. Mankar would eventually be slain in his Paradise, whereas Martin Septim would meet his end after he destroyed the Amulet of Kings in order to banish Mehrunes Dagon.</p>

    <h3 id="fourth_era"> Fourth Era</h3>
    <p>During 4E 201, the prophecy of the Last Dragonborn would come to pass. Alduin, who had been banished from Tamriel since the Merethic Era by an Elder Scroll, returned to the land, indirectly helping the Last Dragonborn to escape an Imperial execution at Helgen by destroying the town. The Last Dragonborn would learn of their nature while aiding the city of Whiterun by slaying the Dragon Mirmulnir at the Western Watchtower of Whiterun. Upon defeating the Dragon, the Dragonborn gained its soul, and through the Word of Power that the Dragonborn had learned previously in a mission of the court wizard, was able to use the Thu'um.</p>

    <p>After learning Dragonrend, the Last Dragonborn was able to face off against Alduin atop the Throat of the World, winning a minor victory against the World-Eater, though Alduin did escape to Sovngarde. The Dragonborn would give chase, and through the help of Odahviing, they would gain access to Skuldafn and its portal to Sovngarde. In Sovngarde, the Last Dragonborn would meet up with the three Nord Tongues of old, Gormlaith, Hakon, and Felldir, and together they faced off against Alduin, defeating him in combat. It is unknown if Alduin was truly slain, as in contrast to regular Dragons, his soul was not absorbed. The leader of the Greybeards, Arngeir, believed that it may have been possible that he could return to fulfill his true destiny, though that was for the gods to decide.</p>

    <p>The First Dragonborn, Miraak, had also gained more power since his defeat by Vahlok. Upon learning of the Last Dragonborn, he had sent out cultists with the orders to defeat the Dragonborn. The Last Dragonborn would travel to Solstheim, where the cultists had originated, in order to find the origin of the cultists. Here, they would discover that Miraak had corrupted the All-Maker Stones in order to increase his power for his planned return. During their quest to stop Miraak, Miraak held the power to transport to the Last Dragonborn every time they slew a Dragon, and steal the Dragon's soul before the Last Dragonborn could absorb it. With the aid of Hermaeus Mora, the Last Dragonborn would learn the necessary powers required to defeat Miraak, primarily the Bend Will Shout. The Last Dragonborn would travel to Apocrypha one last time to face Miraak in combat. After a long battle, Hermaeus Mora ended the conflict by slaying Miraak for his treachery, and naming the Last Dragonborn his champion. This was because Hermaeus Mora did not desire Miraak to be set free from his direct control, and instead wanted a more loyal servant. </p>
